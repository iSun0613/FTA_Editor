## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/FTA_editor.git
cd FTA_editor

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run application
python src/FTA_Editor_UI.py
```

## Coding Standards

### Python Style

- Follow PEP 8
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

Example:
```python
def calculate_probability(node, mode="FTA"):
    """
    Calculate probability for a node.
    
    Args:
        node (dict): Node data structure
        mode (str): "FTA" or "ETA"
        
    Returns:
        float: Calculated probability
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use descriptive test names
- Test edge cases

Example:
```python
def test_eta_mode_calculation():
    """Test ETA mode calculates probabilities top-down."""
    core = FTACore()
    core.set_metadata(mode="ETA")
    # ... test implementation
    assert result == expected
```

### Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update docs/ for API changes
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Include examples in docstrings

## Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Specific test file
python tests/test_core_module.py

# With coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

### Writing Tests

- Use pytest framework
- One test file per source file
- Name tests clearly: `test_<feature>_<scenario>`
- Use fixtures for common setup
- Test both success and error cases

## Documentation

### Required Documentation

- README.md - Overview and quick start
- API changes - Update docs/API_REFERENCE.md
- New features - Update docs/USER_GUIDE.md
- Docstrings - All public functions/classes

### Documentation Style

- Include examples
- Use proper markdown formatting
- Add diagrams where helpful

## Commit Messages

Format:
- First line: Summary (max 50 chars)
- Blank line
- Detailed description
- Reference issues/PRs
