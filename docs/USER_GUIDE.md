## Understanding FTA vs ETA

### FTA (Fault Tree Analysis) - Bottom-Up

**Purpose**: Analyze how component failures lead to system failure

**Calculation Direction**: Children → Parent

**Example Use Case**: "What causes the system to fail?"

```
System Failure (Parent calculated from children)
├─ Component A Fails (0.1)
├─ Component B Fails (0.2)  } → Parent probability calculated
└─ Component C Fails (0.15)     from these children
```

**When to Use FTA**:
- Reliability engineering
- Root cause analysis
- Failure mode analysis
- Quality control

### ETA (Event Tree Analysis) - Top-Down

**Purpose**: Analyze possible outcomes following an initiating event

**Calculation Direction**: Parent → Children

**Example Use Case**: "What happens if this event occurs?"

```
Initiating Event (0.001)
├─ Path A (0.9) → Calc: 0.001 × 0.9 = 0.0009
│  ├─ Outcome A1 (0.8) → Calc: 0.0009 × 0.8 = 0.00072
│  └─ Outcome A2 (0.2) → Calc: 0.0009 × 0.2 = 0.00018
└─ Path B (0.1) → Calc: 0.001 × 0.1 = 0.0001
```

**When to Use ETA**:
- Safety analysis
- Accident sequence analysis
- Risk assessment
- Consequence modeling

## AI Assistant

The AI Assistant provides intelligent analysis and suggestions for your fault trees using OpenAI-compatible APIs.

### Setup

1. Click the **⚙ (Settings)** button in the AI Assistant panel
2. Enter your API credentials:
   - **API Key**: Your OpenAI or compatible API key
   - **API Endpoint**: `https://api.openai.com/v1` (default) or your custom endpoint
   - **Model**: Select gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, or other models
3. Click **Test & Save** to verify and store credentials

> **Security**: Credentials are stored locally at `~/.fta_editor/ai_credentials.json`, never in the repository.

### Features

**Quick Actions**:
- **Analyze FTA**: Posts analysis and suggestions to chat only (no changes applied).
- **Update FTA**: AI generates a complete updated JSON, validates it, and replaces the current tree. Existing nodes are preserved; only additions are applied. Detailed error logs are shown if the AI output is invalid.
- **Clear Chat**: Reset conversation history

**Free Chat**:
Type any question in the input box and press Enter. Examples:
- "What root causes might be missing from this failure mode?"
- "Can you review the probabilities in this tree?"
- "What are common causes of pump failures?"

### Applying Changes

- Use **Analyze FTA** for a safe review-only mode.
- Use **Update FTA** to apply all additions at once: the AI returns a full JSON which is verified before replacing your current tree. If the JSON is invalid, the update is rejected and the problematic section is shown in the chat and console.

### Status Indicator

- **● (Green)**: AI is configured and ready
- **○ (Gray)**: AI not configured - click ⚙ to set up

## Working with Nodes

### Adding a Node

1. Select parent node in tree
2. Click "Add Node" button (or press Ctrl+A)
3. Fill in node details:
   - **Name**: Descriptive name
   - **Type**: Event, Gate, etc.
   - **Probability**: Base probability (0.0-1.0)
   - **Logic Gate**: AND or OR (for nodes with children)
   - **Notes**: Optional description

### Editing a Node

1. Select node in tree
2. Click "Edit Node" button (or press Ctrl+E)
3. Modify any fields
4. Save changes

### Deleting a Node

1. Select node in tree
2. Click "Delete Node" button (or press Ctrl+D)
3. Confirm deletion
4. All children are also deleted

### Node Linking

**Create Link Between Nodes**:
1. Edit the node where link originates
2. Add link in the "Links" section
3. Select target node
4. Choose relationship: AND or OR

**Link Relationships**:
- **AND Link**: Both nodes must occur (multiply probabilities)
- **OR Link**: At least one occurs (union formula)

## Probability Calculations

### FTA Mode Calculations

**For Leaf Nodes** (no children):
```
Calculated Probability = Base Probability
```

**For Nodes with Children**:

AND Gate:
```
Calculated = Base × Product(Child1, Child2, ...)
```

OR Gate:
```
Calculated = 1 - Product((1-Child1), (1-Child2), ...)
```

**With Links**:
1. Calculate from children (if any)
2. Apply AND links: multiply
3. Apply OR links: union formula

### ETA Mode Calculations

**For All Nodes**:
```
Child Calculated = Parent Calculated × Child Base
```

Flows top-down from root to leaves.

### Zero Probability Nodes

Nodes with zero probability are marked with red asterisk (*) in tree view.

**Common Causes**:
- Base probability set to 0.0
- In FTA: child with 0.0 probability in AND gate
- In ETA: parent has 0.0 calculated probability

## Examples

### Example 1: Server Reliability (FTA)

**Scenario**: Analyze server downtime causes

1. Set Mode to "FTA"
2. Create root: "Server Unavailable"
3. Add children:
   - Hardware Failure (0.1)
   - Software Crash (0.15)
   - Network Issue (0.08)
4. Set root Logic Gate to "OR"
5. Result: Root calculated probability shows overall failure rate

### Example 2: Nuclear Safety (ETA)

**Scenario**: Analyze loss of coolant accident sequences

1. Set Mode to "ETA"
2. Create root: "Loss of Coolant" (0.001)
3. Add branches:
   - ECCS Activates (0.99)
     - Core Cooled (0.98)
     - Partial Cooling (0.02)
   - ECCS Fails (0.01)
     - Core Meltdown (1.0)
4. Calculated probabilities show each outcome likelihood

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Probabilities seem wrong after mode switch**
A: Different modes calculate differently - this is expected. FTA is bottom-up, ETA is top-down.

**Q: Can't see diagram preview**
A: Ensure Graphviz is installed and in your PATH.

**Q: Zero probability nodes everywhere**
A: Check that probabilities are set > 0. In FTA mode, check logic gates.

**Q: Excel export fails**
A: Ensure openpyxl is installed: `pip install openpyxl`

**Q: Legacy JSON files don't load properly**
A: Old format is supported, but defaults to FTA mode. Set mode manually after loading.

**Q: AI Assistant shows "not configured"**
A: Click the ⚙ button in the AI panel to enter your API credentials.

**Q: AI connection test fails**
A: Verify your API key is valid and has available credits. Check internet connection.

**Q: AI responses are slow**
A: Consider using a faster model like `gpt-4o-mini`. Check your API rate limits.

**Q: AI suggestions don't apply correctly**
A: Ensure you've reviewed and selected the changes in the confirmation dialog.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Names**: Make nodes self-explanatory
2. **Document with Dates**: Always fill in the date field
3. **Add Notes**: Use notes field for important context
4. **Save Frequently**: Use Ctrl+S regularly
5. **Validate Results**: Check calculated probabilities make sense
6. **Export Regularly**: Keep Excel/XML exports for sharing

## Advanced Features

### Using Links

Links allow dependencies between non-parent/child nodes:

```
Node A (0.5)
  Link→ AND to Node B (0.8)
  Result: A's probability becomes 0.5 × 0.8 = 0.4
```

### Mixed AND/OR Gates

You can have different logic gates at different levels:
- Root: OR gate (any child causes failure)
- Children: AND gates (all sub-components must fail)

### Circular Reference Handling

The calculator detects circular references and uses base probability to break the cycle.
